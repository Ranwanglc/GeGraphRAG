Initially, it was mentioned that Vision Holdings previously owned TechGlobal from 2014 until present. This suggests that Vision Holdings acquired TechGlobal in 2014 and retained ownership until its current status.\n\nHowever, the second description states that Vision Holdings previously owned TechGlobal \"from 2014 until present.\" This contradicts the first description, which indicates that it acquired TechGlobal in 2014 but still retains ownership. To resolve this contradiction, we can conclude that Vision Holdings indeed acquired TechGlobal in 2014 and retained ownership.\n\nThe third description provides additional context by stating that Vision Holdings previously owned TechGlobal \"from 2014 until present.\" This confirms the previous conclusion that Vision Holdings acquired TechGlobal in 2014 but still retains ownership. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Vision Holdings has been the owner of TechGlobal since its inception in 2014.\n\nIn summary, VISION HOLDINGS has a history with TechGlobal, having previously owned it from 2014 until present. The entity has acquired TechGlobal and retained ownership throughout this period.\n\nThe comprehensive description can be summarized as follows:\n\nVision Holdings is a firm that previously owned TechGlobal, acquiring it in 2014 and retaining ownership to the present day.
