According to one description, he spent time in Tiruzia's Alhamia Prison as well. This suggests that Samuel Namara may have been involved in a complex web of events involving multiple locations and entities.\n\nIt appears that Samuel Namara was initially imprisoned by the Aurelian authorities at Alhamia Prison for an unknown duration.
