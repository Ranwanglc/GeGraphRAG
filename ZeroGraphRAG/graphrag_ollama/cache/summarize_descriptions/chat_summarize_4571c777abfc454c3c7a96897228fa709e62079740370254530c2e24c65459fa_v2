This event occurred simultaneously for both parties involved.\n\nSamuel Namara was also part of this exchange, but his role is not explicitly mentioned in the provided descriptions. However, considering the context of the exchange programs and the fact that Durke Bataglani was already involved, it can be inferred that Samuel Namara might have been another individual who participated in the same program.\n\nThe primary focus of these events appears to be on the exchange of individuals between two groups or entities, with no explicit mention of a third entity. The descriptions provided do not offer any additional information about other entities involved in this specific exchange.\n\nIn summary, Meggie Tazbah and Durke Bataglani were exchanged for Samuel Namara during a hostage release event, which occurred simultaneously for both parties.
