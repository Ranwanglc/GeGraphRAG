This city is located in Iran and has been involved in various events throughout history. One of the most notable descriptions is that FIRUZABAD held Aurelians as hostages. However, this description seems contradictory to another one stating that FIRUZABAD is a city where many entities are located.\n\nTo resolve this contradiction, it appears that the entity \"Aurelians\" refers to a specific group or people, and FIRUZABAD's involvement in holding them as hostages may be related to their presence in the city. This could imply that Aurelians were being held captive by the citizens of FIRUZABAD.\n\nThe description also mentions that FIRUZABAD is a city in Iran where many entities are located. This suggests that FIRUZABAD is not just a specific location, but rather a hub or center for various entities to gather, interact, and operate.\n\nGiven this information, it can be inferred that FIRUZABAD is a complex entity with multiple facets. It appears to be a city in Iran where Aurelians are held as hostages, and also serves as a hub for many other entities to congregate.\n\nIn summary, the comprehensive description of FIRUZABAD is:\n\nFIRUZABAD is a city located in Iran that has been involved in various events throughout history. It holds Aurelians as hostages, but this may be related to their presence in the city rather than being held captive by its citizens.
