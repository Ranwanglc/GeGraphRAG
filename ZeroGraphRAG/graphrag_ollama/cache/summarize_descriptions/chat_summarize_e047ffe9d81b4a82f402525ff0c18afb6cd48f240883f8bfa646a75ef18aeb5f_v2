This suggests that there may be some confusion or overlap between the two entities.\n\nOn the other hand, the description of Samuel Namara being a prisoner at Alhamia prison seems to contradict the first statement about him being a hostage in Firuzabad. However, it is possible that these descriptions are referring to different aspects of his life or experiences.\n\nTo resolve this contradiction, we can consider the context and clarify the information. It appears that Samuel Namara was indeed held captive at Alhamia prison, but he was not a hostage in Firuzabad. Instead, he was a prisoner who had been taken into custody by authorities for unknown reasons.\n\nIn summary, the comprehensive description of the entity \"FIRUZABAD\" is: A city or region in Iran where Samuel Namara was held captive at Alhamia prison. The entity \"SAMUEL NAMARA\" is associated with two descriptions: one stating that he was a hostage in Firuzabad, and another describing him as a prisoner at Alhamia prison.\n\nThe entity \"FIRUZABAD\" is also associated with the following description: A city or region in Iran known for its historical significance and cultural importance.
